    <article>My favourtie food is pizza. <strong>Hot take</strong>, I believe that pineapple belongs on pizza because it adds a sweet flavour. I enjoy buying shoes now that I couldn't afford as a child. I love fashion I think it is a great way to express your personality. This is all I can think about myself, and now this will be filler words. I am typing this out to reach the word limit to showcase that this is two paragraphs, thank you. </article>
