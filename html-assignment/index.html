    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born in, <strong>Sri Lanka</strong> and immigrated to <strong>Canada</strong> when I was six. My mom is filipino and my dad is Sri Lankan. I'm the 3<sup>rd</sup> brother in my family and the youngest. My hobbies include playing basketball, video and photo creation. I also love to go out with my friends and do various activities. I love my family and I am a big mamas boy. This IMD program will help me sharpen my skills and gain new ones. I'm excited to learn about coding and website development because this carrer path is in demand and very rewarding.</p>

        <p>My favourtie food is pizza. <strong>Hot take</strong>, I believe that pineapple belongs on pizza because it adds a sweet flavour. I enjoy buying shoes now that I couldn't afford as a child. I love fashion I think it is a great way to express your personality. This is all I can think about myself, and now this will be filler words. I am typing this out to reach the word limit to showcase that this is two paragraphs, thank you.</p>
